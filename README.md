curl http://localhost:8080/api/status

# Get attacks with limit (JSON)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/attacks?limit=10
```

## Configuration

### Default Configuration

The application uses sensible defaults but can be extended:

```go
// Default settings in internal/models/models.go
type AttackDetectorConfig struct {
    KnownDevicesFile     string        // "model/known_devices.json"
    BluetoothDevicesFile string        // "model/known_bluetooth_devices.json"
    LogFile             string        // "log/intrusion_log.log"
    ScanInterval        time.Duration // 60 seconds
    AnomalyThreshold    float64       // 2.0 standard deviations
    WebServerPort       int           // 8080
}
```

### Known Devices Files

**Network devices** (`model/known_devices.json`):
```json
["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.20", "192.168.1.100"]
```

**Bluetooth devices** (`model/known_bluetooth_devices.json`):
```json
[
  {"address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF", "name": "My Phone"},
  {"address": "11:22:33:44:55:66", "name": "My Speaker"}
]
```

## Detection Rules

### Device-Based Detection
- **Unknown Device**: Any IP/MAC not previously seen on the network
- **Device Disappeared**: Known device no longer responding to scans
- **Unusual Device Count**: Sudden appearance of multiple new devices

### Port-Based Detection
- **Suspicious Ports**: RDP (3389), Telnet (23), FTP (21), SMB (445)
- **Multiple Open Ports**: More than 5 ports open on a single device
- **Unauthorized Services**: Common attack vectors

### Bluetooth Attack Detection
- **Discovery Attack**: Unknown Bluetooth devices appearing in scans
- **Device Spoofing**: Suspicious device names containing attack-related keywords
- **KNOB Attack**: Devices with unusually strong signals (very close proximity)
- **BIAS Attack**: Duplicate device names indicating impersonation attempts
- **Mass Scanning**: Unusual number of Bluetooth devices detected (>20)

### WiFi Attack Detection
- **Evil Twin**: Duplicate SSID networks with different MAC addresses
- **Rogue AP**: Access points with suspicious naming patterns
- **Weak Encryption**: WEP encryption detection
- **Open Networks**: Networks without any encryption

## Docker Support

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t shheissee-go .
```

Run in container:
```bash
docker run --privileged --net=host shheissee-go monitor
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"command not found" errors:**
```bash
# Install missing system tools
sudo apt install wireless-tools nmap bluetooth bluez bluez-tools
```

**Bluetooth not working:**
```bash
# Ensure Bluetooth service is running
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

# Add user to bluetooth group
sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth $USER
# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# Run with elevated permissions if needed
sudo ./shheissee monitor
```

**Web interface not accessible:**
```bash
# Check if port 8080 is available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8080

# Change port by modifying internal/models/models.go
WebServerPort: 8081,
```

**No devices found:**
```bash
# Network/WiFi: Check wireless interface is up
iwconfig

# Bluetooth: Check Bluetooth adapter status
bluetoothctl show
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by checking the log file:
```bash
tail -f log/intrusion_log.log
```

### Performance Tuning

Adjust scan intervals in `internal/models/models.go`:
```go
ScanInterval: 30 * time.Second,  // More frequent scanning
ScanInterval: 120 * time.Second, // Less frequent scanning
```
